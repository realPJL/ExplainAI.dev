# ExplainAI.dev

## Overview
**ExplainAI.dev** is a centralized platform for tracking and comparing AI models. It provides up-to-date information on AI model benchmarks, pricing, capabilities, and real-world performance, helping developers, researchers, and businesses choose the best AI model for their needs.

## Features
### üîç AI Model Database
- Catalog of AI models (GPT-4, Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, Mistral, Gemini, Llama, etc.).
- Each model includes:
  - Performance Benchmarks
  - Pricing ($/1M tokens, $/hour, etc.)
  - Speed & Latency (API response times)
  - Training Data & Special Features
  - Best Use Cases (chatbots, coding, research, etc.)

### üìä Benchmark Comparison
- Side-by-side comparisons of model performance.
- Filtering by:
  - Best for Chatbots
  - Best for Code Generation
  - Best for Cost Efficiency
  - Best for Low Latency

### üí≤ AI Pricing Tracker
- Tracks API pricing for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Mistral, etc.).
- Real-time updates on pricing changes.
- Sorting Options: Lowest Cost, Highest Accuracy, Best Performance.
